CSS3 Gradient Generator
=======================

A tool to help web-devs generate CSS Code for Gradients using an interactive GUI.

The CSS3 Gradient Generator makes use of Canvas and jS to capture and process mouse events, which seems cleaner in code than the above version. I plan to develop this version of the CSS3 Gradient Generator purely using HTML5 (without using any jS Library).

Development Status: Work In Progress.
